# NICsExampleProjects

This is a place where I will put all of my projects that can be used as example of what I know.
Projects get more complex as times go on but i am starting from basically nothing and going to try to work my way up unitl a point
where i am able to make contributions to other projects for either friends or even in a workplace.

My goal is to move into software development or software engineering.
