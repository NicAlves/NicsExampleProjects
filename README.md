# NICsExampleProjects

This is a place where I will put all of my projects that can be used as example of what I know.
Projects get more complex as times go on but i am starting from basically nothing and going to try to work my way up unitl a point
where i am able to make contributions to other projects for either friends or even in a workplace.

The ONLY project that is worth looking at that I made completely on my own without any outside help is the Finance Calculator.

ZombieShooter was done by me but I had help from my best friend who is a Unity Game developer

Budget Calculator is still being created. I havent touched it since starting it due to other commitments
