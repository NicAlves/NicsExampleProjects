				<H3>Personal Statement:</H3>
				<p>I have always had a passion for computers, technology, software, and gaming. I have a good problem-solving mindset, always looking for new solutions in a logical way. Working in IT means I am always problem solving, troubleshooting, and resolving issues. I enjoy working independently, when need be, but I also enjoy working within a team and having good working relationships. My ambition is to move into a more dev orientated role (Web Dev, Software Dev, DevOps). I look forward to what the future could hold for me within this industry.</p>

							<h2>Cloud Operations Junior Engineer</h2>

							<h4>July 2022 - Present</h4>
						</div>
						<p>Currently working within Cloud Operations, my main duty is to monitor the health of the platform and troubleshoot and fix the issues that come up, talking to the relevant teams to help get the issues resolved if it is more complex. As a Junior Engineer I am constantly trying to learn new things regarding the platform and new troubleshooting techniques. Using and updating documentation is also a big part of the day-to-day work. I am also being given the opportunity to delve into automation using PowerShell and Python. As part of my role, I am exposed to a wide variety of technologies, including Linux, VMware, OpenStack, Storage solutions and more. The team's goal is to maintain 99.99% of availability for our customers.</p>
						<h4>Other responsibilites include:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Daily & Nightly backups performance checks & reporting</li>
							<li>24/7 infrastructure monitoring of business-critical services using OpsView & Moogsoft</li>

							<h2>IT Infrastructure Technician</h2>
							<h3>UKCloud</h3>
							<h4>April 2021 - July 2022</h4>
						</div>
						<p>During my time as an apprentice with UKCloud, I worked in a small team to support hundreds of staff members within the company. This involved using tools such as Active Directory/Azure Active Directory, Intune, PDQ Inventory/Deploy, Office 365, Atlassian Jira/Confluence to service and action internal IT requests. My role also involved deploying and maintaining laptops and other hardware for employees, desks, and meeting rooms within the office. I also spent 6 months with our customer support / 1st line support team where constant communication with customers and internal teams was essential to ensure that any tickets were resolved in line with our SLAs. In addition to this I also spent time with the Cloud Operations team where I subsequently secured a full-time position after passing my apprenticeship.</p>

					<summary>About me</summary>
					<p>In my spare time I really enjoy video games, riding my motorcycle along with tinkering with it. I have also recently started a hobby in game development in which I use Unity and C#, I have also started learning PowerShell, SQL and Python to continue to grow my interest in development. I also love tinkering with computers - full system builds, upgrading components, and helping family and friends with anything tech related. I also have a love for aviation, using flight simulators, going to my local airfield to get my fix. As I lived in South Africa until the age of 15, I was able to speak Afrikaans, although it has faded in the last couple years.</p>
